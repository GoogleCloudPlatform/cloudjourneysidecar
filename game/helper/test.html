<p>\n<strong>Malcolm</strong>: I'm just a sysadmin. I write a lot of bash. <p>If I switch to Golang, can I change my <p>title to SRE? <h3>Page: 1</h3>
<p>\n<strong>Malcolm</strong>: Can I say I'm DevOps so I don't have to go <p>to the developer's desk to launch <p>application code changes? <p>\n<strong>Moira</strong>: Does that mean I can deploy VMs whenever<p>*I* want to?<p>\n<strong>Malcolm</strong>: Um, but, no, I want to do what I want and<p>not let you do what you want. <p>\n<strong>Moira</strong>: Typical. <p>\n<strong>Malcolm</strong>: I hear that you need a sysadmin to join the<p>team. I've been told it is in my best <p>interest to offer to help. Can I join?<p>\n<strong>Moira</strong>: No jerks, Malcolm.  <p>\n<strong>Malcolm</strong>: I'm sorry. I've been cranky about DevOps <p>ever since I had to change all my scripts<p>from Bash to Ruby just to fit in. <p>\n<strong>Malcolm</strong>: I'll be good, and I'll spin up any VM you <p>need. <p>\n<strong>Moira</strong>: I can live with that. Welcome to the party, <p>Mal. <p>\n<strong>Malcolm</strong>: We should talk to my TL, Lydia to find <p>out what she needs us to do.<h3>Page: 2</h3>
