package main

// Whis is this an emply go app? Because this is a dispatched application. And
// there appear to be slight differences between the local SDK for Python and
// Go.  In short to get a dispatched app with several different module runtimes
// working was a bit beyond me.  This allows me to run one local SDK - Go. Not
// perfect but it is also not killing anyone.
